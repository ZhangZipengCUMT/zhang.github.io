When designing and optimizing the hull of vehicles, their sound quality needs to be considered, which greatly depends on the psychoacoustic parameters. However, the traditional psychoacoustic calculation method does not consider the influence of the real human ear anatomic structure, even the loudness which is most related to the auditory periphery. In order to introduce the real physiological structure of the human ear into the evaluation of vehicle sound quality, this paper first carried out the vehicle internal noise test to obtain the experimental samples. Then, the physiological loudness was predicted based on an established human ear physiological model, and the noise evaluation vector was constructed by combining the remaining four psychoacoustic parameters. Finally, the evaluation vector was fitted into the subjective evaluation results of vehicle interior noise by a deep neural network. The results show that our proposed method can estimate the human subjective perception of vehicle interior noise well.
