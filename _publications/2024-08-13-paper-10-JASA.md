In order to improve the prediction accuracy of the sound quality of vehicle interior noise, a novel sound quality prediction model was proposed based on the physiological response predicted metrics, i.e., loudness, sharpness, and roughness. First, a human-ear sound transmission model was constructed by combining the outer and middle ear finite element model with the cochlear transmission line model. This model converted external input noise into cochlear basilar membrane response. Second, the physiological perception models of loudness, sharpness, and roughness were constructed by transforming the basilar membrane response into sound perception related to neuronal firing. Finally, taking the calculated loudness, sharpness, and roughness of the physiological model and the subjective evaluation values of vehicle interior noise as the parameters, a sound quality prediction model was constructed by TabNet model. The results demonstrate that the loudness, sharpness, and roughness computed by the human-ear physiological model exhibit a stronger correlation with the subjective evaluation of sound quality annoyance compared to traditional psychoacoustic parameters. Furthermore, the average error percentage of sound quality prediction based on the physiological model is only 3.81%, which is lower than that based on traditional psychoacoustic parameters.
